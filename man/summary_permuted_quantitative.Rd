\title{summary_permuted_quantitative function
This function outputs the p value of permuted model in the target dataset, using pre-generated GWAS and/or GWEIS summary statistics, and Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs) of all the individuals. Note that the input files used in this function can be generated by using GWAS_quantitative and/or GWEIS_quantitative, and PRS_quantitative functions. It is recommended to run this function, if you choose to fit 'PRS_gxe x E' interaction component (i.e. novel proposed model, Model 4) when generating risk scores. If the 'PRS_gxe x E' term is significant in Model 4, and insignificant in Model 4* (permuted p value), consider that the 'PRS_gxe x E' interaction component is actually insignificant (always give priority to the p value obtained from the permuted model).}
\usage{

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Qphe_target}{Phenotype file containing family ID, individual ID and phenotype of the target dataset as columns, without heading}

\item{Qcov_target}{Covariate file containing family ID, individual ID, standardized covariate, square of standardized covariate, and/or confounders of the target dataset as columns, without heading}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations used in permutation}

\item{add_score}{The .sscore file generated using additive SNP effects of GWEIS summary statistics}

\item{gxe_score}{The .sscore file generated using interaction SNP effects of GWEIS summary statistics}

This function will output
