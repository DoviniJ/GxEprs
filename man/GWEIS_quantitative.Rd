\title{GWEIS_quantitative function
This function performs GWEIS using plink2 and outputs the GWEIS summary statistics with additive SNP effects and interaction SNP effects separately. It is recommended to save the outputs in separate user-specified files (see examples).}
\usage{
GWEIS_quantitative(
  plink_path,
  b_file,
  Qphe_discovery,
  Qcov_discovery,
  thread = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plink_path}{Path to the PLINK executable application}

\item{b_file}{Prefix of the binary files, where all .fam, .bed and .bim files have a common prefix}

\item{Qphe_discovery}{Phenotype file containing family ID, individual ID and phenotype of the discovery dataset as columns, without heading}

\item{Qcov_discovery}{Covariate file containing family ID, individual ID, standardized covariate, square of standardized covariate, and/or confounders of the discovery dataset as columns, without heading}

\item{thread}{Number of threads used}
}
\value{
This function will perform GWEIS and output
\item{Q_out.add.sum}{GWEIS summary statistics with additive SNP effects}
\item{Q_out.gxe.sum}{GWEIS summary statistics with interaction SNP effects}
}
