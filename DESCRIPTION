Description: A novel PRS model is introduced to enhance the prediction accuracy by utilising GxE effects. 
  This package performs Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Genome Wide Environment Interaction Studies (GWEIS) 
  using a discovery dataset. The package has the ability to obtain polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for a target sample. 
  Finally it predicts the risk values of each individual in the target sample. Users have the choice of using existing 
  models (Li et al., 2015)<doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdu565>, (Pandis et al., 2013)<doi.org/10.1093/ejo/cjt054>, 
  (Peyrot et al., 2018)<doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.09.009> and (Song et al., 2022)<doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32407-9>, 
  as well as newly proposed models for genomic risk prediction (refer to the URL for more details).
