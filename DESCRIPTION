Description: The 'GxEprs' is an R package to detect and estimate GxE.It uses a novel PRS model that can 
             enhance the prediction accuracy by utilising GxE effects. It performs Genome Wide 
             Association Studies (GWAS) and Genome Wide Environment Interaction Studies (GWEIS) using 
             a discovery dataset. The package has the ability to obtain polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for  
             a target sample. Finally it predicts the risk values of each individual in the target sample.
